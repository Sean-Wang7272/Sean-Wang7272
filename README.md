## Hi, I'm Sean 👋

I'm an engineering student currently focusing on learning **C#** for industrial automation.
I use this GitHub account to document my progress in software development and hardware control.

### 🔧 What I'm working on
- **C# Application Development:** Writing host software (Upper Computer) to control **Dobot CR5 robot arms**.
- **Motion Control:** Implementing synchronization logic for **ZMC-412** motors using C#.
- **Hardware Communication:** Learning how to interface software with industrial hardware.

### 📚 Learning goals
- Build a solid foundation in C# and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Improve skills in debugging and optimizing control logic.
- Bridge the gap between engineering theory and practical code implementation.

### 📁 Repositories
Most repositories here are practice projects tracking my C# learning curve.
They may be simple demos or partial implementations, but each represents a step forward in coding.

Thanks for visiting!
