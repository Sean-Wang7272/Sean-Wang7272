## Hi, I'm Sean 👋

I'm an engineering student currently focusing on learning C# and basic software development.
I use this GitHub account to document my learning process and maintain small practice projects.

### 🔧 What I'm working on
- C# fundamentals and object-oriented programming
- Simple desktop applications
- Code structure and readability

### 📚 Learning goals
- Improve problem-solving skills through hands-on projects
- Build a solid foundation in software development
- Gradually explore more advanced topics

### 📁 Repositories
Most repositories here are practice or learning-oriented projects.
They may be simple, but each one reflects a step forward.

Thanks for visiting!
